# Fine-Tuning Language Models for API Query Generation

## Project Overview

This project aims to fine-tune a smaller Large Language Model (LLM) for the specific task of translating natural language queries (NLQs) into structured API queries, with an initial focus on Elasticsearch's Query DSL. The motivation behind this effort is to significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of API endpoints, making them more intuitive for users by allowing interactions in natural language.

The concept extends beyond Elasticsearch, proposing a universal approach to interfacing with various APIs. By leveraging compact, efficient language models, we envision a future where sophisticated API interactions are democratized, enabling more natural and user-friendly application interfaces.

## Motivation

While Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, their size and resource requirements often limit widespread deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. This project explores the potential of smaller, optimized models to perform complex tasks—like generating accurate API queries from NLQs—while maintaining low latency, minimal memory footprint, and reduced power consumption. Such models can revolutionize API interactions across numerous platforms, making technology more accessible and intuitive for a broader user base.

## Objective

- **Fine-Tune a Language Model**: Adapt a smaller LLM to accurately translate NLQs into Elasticsearch JSON queries based on given Elasticsearch mappings.
- **Demonstrate Versatility**: Although focused on Elasticsearch, highlight the model's potential applicability to various APIs, including but not limited to SQL databases, web services, and more.
- **Showcase Efficiency**: Emphasize the model's operational efficiency, making the case for its deployment in diverse environments, from serverless architectures to edge devices.

## Inspiration

This work is inspired by existing models that translate NLQs into SQL queries, acknowledging their groundbreaking role in bridging the gap between natural language and database querying. By extending this concept to Elasticsearch and beyond, we aim to contribute to the growing field of natural language processing applications in API interactions.

## Synthetic Data Generation

### Overview

The foundation of our fine-tuning process involves creating a rich dataset of NLQs paired with their corresponding Elasticsearch JSON queries. This section details our approach to synthetic data generation, ensuring a broad coverage of query types and complexities.

### Process

1. **Define Elasticsearch Mappings**: Create diverse mappings that represent different data domains, from e-commerce to public records.
2. **Generate NLQs**: For each mapping, develop a variety of natural language queries that reflect potential user intents.
3. **Craft Corresponding JSON Queries**: Construct accurate Elasticsearch queries for each NLQ, demonstrating the desired output for the model.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Variability and Complexity**: Addressed by including a wide range of query scenarios and incorporating both basic and advanced Elasticsearch functionalities.
- **Realism**: Ensured by basing synthetic data on realistic use cases and varying the structure and complexity of mappings.

## Fine-Tuning Process

This section outlines the steps taken to adapt the language model to our specific task, including model selection, training environment setup, and evaluation metrics.

### Model Selection

Criteria for choosing a suitable smaller LLM include performance, efficiency, and adaptability to the task of generating structured API queries.

### Training and Evaluation

- **Dataset Preparation**: Split the synthetic data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Training Environment**: Configure the computational resources and fine-tuning parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and execution success rate to assess the model's performance.

## Future Directions

While the initial focus is on Elasticsearch, the methodology and findings from this project have broader implications. Future work will explore extending this approach to other APIs, further reducing model size without compromising performance, and investigating deployment strategies for real-time applications.
